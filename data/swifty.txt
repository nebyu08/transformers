""" Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[6]

Swift's mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles C. A. Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[11] whose singing in church became one of her earliest memories in music that shaped her career.[5] Swift is a sixth cousin thrice removed of American poet Emily Dickinson.[12]

Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[13][14] She is a Christian.[15] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[16] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[17] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[18] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[19]

At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[20] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[21] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything".[22] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[23][24] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[25] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[26] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[27] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was fourteen years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[28][29]

In 2002, when Swift was around twelve years old, local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[30] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[31] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then thirteen years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[32][33][34] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was fourteen years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[13][35] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[36] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[37][38]

2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album
In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[39][40] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[41] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[42] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[43] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[34][24] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going
